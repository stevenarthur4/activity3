It requires "an understanding of the learning context and how to use various technologies to promote learning" (ED PS 6446 syllabus).<br><br>This portfolio provides evidence that I have obtained technology integration skills as a masters student. Each skill presented below is connected to a different educational technology standard -- all of which are accessible by clicking on the standard. You can find evidence of each skill as you click on the accompanying image. As I still have much room to grow in effectively integrating such technologies, I also included a goal of how I would like to further incorporate and increase my performance of each skill. I hope you enjoy!</p>

        <p>Claim: I can design, develop, and evaluate authentic learning experiences...incorporating contemporary tools and resources to maximize content learning in context and to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes identified in the NETS•S.</p>
        <p>Reflection: Instead of just teaching elementary students about archipelagos using traditional "stand-and-deliver" methods, I used Adobe Spark to design and develop a learning experience to encourage the students to attain the concept of an archipelago themselves. I chose this tool as it is different from previous technology tools that I have used, and it is more visually appealing than traditional PowerPoint.</p>

        </span>
          <p>Goal: While I do not teach elementary school students, my practice with Adobe Spark has enlightened my mind into other possibilities outside of PowerPoint -- which I have been using in my teaching for years.  I know PowerPoint still can be an effective tool; however, I will incorporate Adobe Spark more into my teaching experiences. For certain topics, I also will incorporate more the concept attainment learning model as I believe it maximizes a student's ability to determine key concepts.</p>

              <p>Claim: I can use multiple methods of assessment to engage learners in their own growth, monitor learner progress, guide planning and instruction, and determine whether the outcomes described in content standards have been met.</p>
        <p>Reflection: I used Quizlet and Quizizz -- two already-created digital tools -- to conduct formative assessments in order to help my students learn the references to key scriptural passages. Over the past two years of using a new initiative to help students learn certain scriptural passages (i.e., their meaning, how to apply them, and their references), I have noticed the students mainly struggle with recalling the references.  I often realize this at the end of the semester.<br><br>To fill in this gap, I created brief quizzes in both tools to help them review and recall these passages.  Some of the questions list the scripture reference, requiring the students to choose the key phrase; other questions list the key phrase, requiring students to choose the reference.</p>

        </span>
          <p>Goal: I will be much more engaged in conducting formative assessments throughout the semester. In the past, I really have never used technology to conduct formative assessments; I never was aware of the different tools, and did not want to take the time to discover them.  However, I have discovered the great value and fun they are, and will use them often. I'm sure my students won't complain. In addition to these tools, I also plan to use other assessment tools, such as Plickers, Classflow, and Quiznetic.</p>

            <p>Claim: I understand and apply information literacy strategies to evaluate the quality of educational resources and tools.</p>
            <p>Reflection: According to Susan Manning and Kevin E. Johnson in "The Technology Toolbelt for Teaching," a Decision Matrix takes "multiple components into consideration when choosing a [technology] tool, keeping in mind that meeting [the] course goals and objectives are the primary concerns. What follows is a list of considerations to keep in mind when choosing a teaching tool," (Manning and Johnson, 2011). I evaluated the quality of an online interactive learning module called "Plickers" to determine if it is the right teaching tool for me to use when conducting formative assessments with my high school students. This evaluation covered all aspects of the tool, from privacy and data concerns to cost of the product.</p>

        </span>
           <p>Goal: I will apply the strategies I have acquired to evaluate future technology tools, particularly if I can see it as a valuable resource and there is cost involved. I recognize the time and money that can be saved by conducting such an evaluation prior to the purchase or attemped use of the product. Doing such should increase my overall effectiveness in incorporating technology tools.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-5"><a href="https://www.uen.org/k12educator/uets/#s7">Standard: Instructional Strategies</a></h2>
            <p>Claim: I use various instructional strategies to ensure that all learners develop a deep understanding of content areas and their connections, and build skills to apply and extend knowledge in meaningful ways.</p>
            <p>Reflection: I created an instructional video to teach individuals how to write a basic character in traditional Chinese. I tried to connect the learners with the concept behind the character so it is more easily understood, and then outlined the three required strokes in writing the character. Many think Chinese is impossible to learn; this video is designed to help anyone develop a foundational understanding of how to write Chinese and then build off of it. Although I am not a native Chinese speaker, I lived two years in Taiwan and studied it in college as well.</p>

        </span>
          <p>Goal: This was my first attempt at creating an instructional video, but it will not be my last. I realized that I personally use many instructional videos for many learning experiences. This instructional strategy is a <italic>very</italic> effective tool that helps many learners develop understanding, especially for the rising generation. As a teacher of youth, I will incorporate it more for certain concepts that some of my students struggle with.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-5"><a href="https://ed-psych.utah.edu/instructional-design/">Standard: Technology-Based Learning Environment</a></h2>
          <p>Claim: I possess knowledge and skills necessary to create technology-based learning environments in which learner needs and goals are met with and supported by technology.</p>
            <p>Reflection: I am in the process of creating an eLearning module for writing Chinese characters. This PowerPoint version is the low-fidelity prototype; the high-fidelity version will be completed using Adobe Captivate. This low-fidelity prototype, while incomplete and very rough, provides a flavor of the technology-based learning environments I have been able to explore. While it will not teach a learner all aspects of writing Chinese characters, it provides them with a foundation based off of someone having no prior experience.</p>

        </span>
          <p>Goal: Creating eLearning modules is not an easy task, yet it is a very enlightening experience for me. After discovering Adobe Captivate's features, I would like to explore and familiarize myself with other eLearning programs. Immersing myself in many technology-based tools will enable me to be more apt to meet the needs and goals of learners. I hope to continue my experience in discovering more of these tools.</p>
